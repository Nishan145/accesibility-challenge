        <h2 class="navi-color">5.Navi (2021)</h2>
        <h3>Roster:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Boombl4</li>
          <li>electroNic</li>
          <li>b1t</li>
          <li>Perfecto</li>

        <img src="./assets/NAVI-2021.webp" alt="NAVI Team">
        <p>The NAVI core of 2021 remains one of the most talented groups of players ever put together. On paper, you have stars in every single position, including the GOAT CS:GO player, s1mple. Throughout 2021, the team became near-unbeatable and fulfilled their destiny by winning PGL Major Stockholm 2021.

            Although 2021 NAVI will surely go down as one of the best teams in CS:GO history, longevity wasn’t exactly on their side. The rise of FaZe Clan in 2022 and the loss of IGL Boombl4 meant longevity will always work against this iteration of NAVI, meaning they can’t be any higher than fifth on this list. Still, we’re happy we got to see one of the best CS:GO teams of all time in the modern era.</p>

      <section class="sk">
        <h2 class="sk-color">4.Luminosity/ SK Gaming (2016)</h2>
        <h3>Roster:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>FalleN</li>
        <li>coldzera</li>
        <li>fer</li>
        <li>TACO</li>
        <li>fnx</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./assets/SK-Gaming-2016.webp" alt="SK">
        <p>If you’re talking about the best CS:GO teams of all time, you can’t leave out the Brazilian team that played under both Luminosity Gaming and SK Gaming throughout 2016. This legendary lineup won back-to-back Majors, albeit with two different organizations. Even still, they came out on top against the other best teams in CS:GO at the time.

            After fnx left the team in early 2017, things were never quite the same. While the remaining core was eventually transferred to MIBR, the players would go their separate ways individually as the years passed. FalleN attempted to bring the project back together with the Last Dance team in 2022, although that fell short of the heights reached back in 2016. Just on the back of the two Major wins alone, the Luminosity / SK Gaming core manages to earn its place on the list as one of the best CS:GO teams of all time.</p>
      </section class="nip">
      <h2 class="nip-color">3. Ninjas In Pyjamas (2012-2014)</h2>
      <h3>Roster:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Xizt</li>
        <li>Fifflaren</li>
        <li>GeT_RiGhT</li>
        <li>friberg</li>
        <li>f0rest</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./assets/NIP-2014.webp" alt="NIP">
      <p>When CS:GO was first released, many teams chose not to move over from 1.6. The first iteration of Ninjas in Pyjamas pounced on the opportunity, grinding the new game to become one of the best CS:GO teams of all time. The result? An 87-map win streak on LAN that will almost certainly never be beaten. No one could touch NIP between 2012 and 2014, with a roster boasting several legends of the game, including GeT_RiGhT and f0rest.

        For their grind, NIP managed to win just a single Major. Given they were involved in the first five CS:GO Major Grand Finals, it’s almost disappointing for the team only to boast one victory. If a couple more of those matches had gone their way, there’s no doubt that NIP could be sat at the top of this list. Instead, they’ll have to settle for number three in the best teams in CS:GO.</p>

      <section class="fnc">
        <h2 class="fnc-color">2. Fnatic (2014-2015)</h2>
        <h3>Roster:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pronax</li>
            <li>JW</li>
            <li>flusha</li>
            <li>KRIMZ</li>
            <li>olofmeister</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./assets/Fnatic-2015.webp" alt="FNATIC">
        <p>While a previous iteration of Fnatic had managed to become CS:GO Major winners, it was the 2014 – 2015 team that cemented themselves as legends. One of the best CS:GO teams of all time, this core managed to win two Majors together back-to-back (three for the org in total), dominating the competition. Names like olofmeister and KRIMZ are household names for CS fans nowadays, but back then, they were writing their story for the first time.

            Even the best teams in CS:GO all came to an end, with the majority of the roster sold to GODSENT in 2016. While they were here, they were great fun to watch.</p>

      <section class="astralis">
        <h2 class="astralis-color">1. Astralis (2018-2020)</h2>
        <h3>Roster</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>gla1ve</li>
            <li>Magisk</li>
            <li>dupreeh</li>
            <li>dev1ce</li>
            <li>Xyp9x</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./assets/Astralis-2018.webp" alt="Astralis">
        <p>It was only ever going to be them. Astralis with Kjaerbye had already won a Major in 2017, but when he was replaced with Magisk, everything changed. Under IGL gla1ve, the 2018 – 2020 core of Astralis redefined the game’s meta, with ways of playing still seen to this day. Every player was a star, with AWPer dev1ce the jewel in the crown for the roster. The team won three back-to-back Majors, a feat that has never been replicated. Make no mistake, this version of Astralis are the best CS:GO team of all time with absolutely no competition.

            The team eventually struggled with the move to online play during COVID, and Magisk and dupreeh moved to Vitality in 2021. It was the end of an era, bringing a close to the best team in CS:GO history.</p>
